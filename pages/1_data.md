## About the data

Standardized stop data are available to download (by location) from the table below. We provide these data in both [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values){:target="_blank"} and [RDS](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/readRDS.html){:target="_blank"} formats. In addition, shapefiles are available for select locations. The table includes a subset of common fields for each location, and indicates whether data are available for at least 70% of records in that location. Some locations have more fields. The reasons for this are documented in the [README](https://github.com/stanford-policylab/opp/blob/master/data_readme.md){:target="_blank"} file. We encourage you to review the location-specific details in the [README](https://github.com/stanford-policylab/opp/blob/master/data_readme.md){:target="_blank"} file before getting started working with the data on your own.
 
The original, unprocessed data we collected contain even more information. We do not document the raw data, but we do provide any documentation we received. Please contact us to access the original records.

Please note that many of these datasets are too large for Excel and will
require programs like R or Python to open.
